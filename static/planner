modal:
the modal will have 3 rules:
1. user must scroll to bottom of the text → checkbox becomes enabled
---> until they scroll to the end, the checkbox is disabled.

2. user must tick checkbox → button becomes enabled
---> if checkbox isn’t ticked, button stays disabled.

3. if they try to click button without checkbox → show error message
---> “please confirm you understand before continuing”.

[ scrollable div with the long text ]
[ checkbox (disabled at first) ]
[ continue button (enabled when checkbox is too) ]
[ hidden error msg (appears if button clicked without checkbox) ]
